## Motivation

To replace [slurm][], [GOLD][] and [maui][] combination with just
slurm.

* Having just slurm without maui means there are less things to go
  wrong
* Overall performance for scheduling and launching jobs is much better
  with just slurm
* GOLD is overly complicated and we don't need many of the features
  from GOLD

## Design

The [[design]] document. So far we have discovered that slurm already
has much of the needed functionality required for "banking". Much of
the [[sbank]] commands are just wrapper scripts to already existing
slurm commands. One of the problems with banking is being consistent,
the sbank wrapper scripts try to provide a workflow to provide a GOLD
like banking system with slurm.

## Deciding on a policy

* Figure out how many CPU hours are available on the cluster.
* Decide on how many projects to support and how many hours to allocate
  to each project.
* Decide on how much to over-subscribe.
* Create accounts for each project or group, perhaps setup a hierachy
  of projects.
* Allocate hours to the projects/groups.
* Review projects and usage. Decide if QOS or fairshare is needed or not
* Go to start.

## Documentation

### Perl scripts

* [[sbalance]]

### Shell scripts

* [[sbank]]
* [[sbank-balance]]
* [[sbank-project]]
* [[sbank-deposit]]

### Experimental scripts

* [[sbank-user]]
* [[sbank-project]]

### Proposed scripts

* [[sbank-report]] -- this might be better provided with the
[[sbank-balance]] script.
