## Motivation

To replace [slurm][], [GOLD][] and [maui][] combination with just
slurm.

* Having just slurm without maui means there are less things to go
  wrong
* Overall performance for scheduling and launching jobs is much better
  with just slurm
* GOLD is overly complicated and we don't need many of the features
  from GOLD

## Design
