[[!meta title="Setup slurm and slurmdbd"]]

The first thing to do is to setup [slurm][] and [slurmdbd][]. This
documentation assumes the user knows basic slurm administration.

Slurmdbd must be configured and working, account enforcing is enabled
in *slurm.conf*

    AccountingStorageEnforce=limits

The following parameters must also be set, we do not want a decay or
reset of the usage that is recorded in slurmdbd.

    PriorityDecayHalfLife=0
    PriorityUsageResetPeriod=NONE

What is also required is a pretty good estimate of the total available
cpu hours that you have on your cluster that you can allocate to
accounts.

Users will need to learn how to use accounts (nothing new here).

sacctmgr and sshare is required and must be working.

If you do not already have a cluster registered and configured in slurm,

	$ sbank cluster create mycluster
