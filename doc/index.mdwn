## About

SLURM Bank, a collection of wrapper scripts

## Motivation

To replace [slurm][], [GOLD][] and [maui][] combination with just
slurm.

* Having just slurm without maui means there are less things to go
  wrong
* Overall performance for scheduling and launching jobs is much better
  with just slurm
* GOLD is overly complicated and we don't need many of the features
  from GOLD

## Design

The [[design]] document. So far we have discovered that slurm already
has much of the needed functionality required for "banking". Much of
the [[sbank]] commands are just wrapper scripts to already existing
slurm commands. One of the problems with banking is being consistent,
the sbank wrapper scripts try to provide a workflow to provide a GOLD
like banking system with slurm.

You can do everything that these wrapper scripts are doing with plain
slurm commands! We stress that these scripts are just fixing the workflows
in managing accounts and users as well as providing some helper tools
to let users manage their own resources.

## Deciding on a policy

* Figure out how many CPU hours are available on the cluster.
* Decide on how many projects to support and how many hours to allocate
  to each project.
* Decide on how much to over-subscribe.
* Create accounts for each project or group, perhaps setup a hierachy
  of projects.
* Allocate hours to the projects/groups.
* Review projects and usage. Decide if QOS or fairshare is needed or not.
* Go to start.

## Documentation

See the [[walkthrough]] for an example of how to implement and use
slurm-bank.

### Shell scripts

* [[sbank]]
* [[sbank-balance]]
* [[sbank-cluster]]
* [[sbank-deposit]]
* [[sbank-project]]
* [[sbank-time]]

### Experimental scripts

* [[sbank-user]]

### Proposed scripts

* [[sbank-report]] -- this might be better provided with the
[[sbank-balance]] script.
