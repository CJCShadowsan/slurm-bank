## Motivation

To replace [slurm][], [GOLD][] and [maui][] combination with just
slurm.

* Having just slurm without maui means there are less things to go
  wrong
* Overall performance for scheduling and launching jobs is much better
  with just slurm
* GOLD is overly complicated and we don't need many of the features
  from GOLD

## Design

The [[design]] document.

## Deciding on a policy

* Figure out how many CPU hours are available on the cluster.
* Decide on how many projects to support and how many hours toallocate
  to each project.
* Decide on how much to over-subscribe.
* Create accounts for each project or group, perhaps setup a hierachy
  of projects.
* Allocate hours to the projects/groups.
* Review projects and usage.
* Go to start.
