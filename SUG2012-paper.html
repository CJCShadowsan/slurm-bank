<h1>Slurm Bank</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>SLURM Bank is a collection of wrapper scripts to give SLURM GOLD-like
capabilities for managing resources. With the SLURM Bank scripts we
are able to provide a simple banking system where we can deposit hours
to an account. Users are associated with these accounts which they use
to run jobs. If users do not have an account or if they do not have
hours in their account then they cannot run jobs.</p>

<p>At TCHPC, we were motivated to replace the resource management and
allocation systems which comprised of three pieces of software (slurm,
GOLD and maui) with just a single piece of software: Slurm. Having all
of the banking functionality in SLURM has benefits for both the
systems administrators:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having just slurm without maui means there are fewer things to go
wrong</li>
<li>Overall performance for scheduling and launching jobs is much better
with just slurm</li>
<li>GOLD is overly complicated and we don't need many of the features
from GOLD</li>
</ul>

<p>And also benefits for end users of clusters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fewer commands/systems to learn</li>
<li>Faster job submission and turn-around</li>
<li>Greater overall system stability</li>
</ul>

<p>The package is not feature complete and there are issues with the
current proposed implementation. Despite this, SLURM Bank has been in
production use at TCHPC for a year with some success.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<ul>
<li>Brief history of TCHPC and systems/resource managers
<ul>
<li>Funding agencies wanted accountability for CPU time; reporting of this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Were running GOLD+Maui+Torque</li>
<li>Tried GOLD+Maui+Slurm
<ul>
<li>interface very unreliable, complex</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wanted to just use Slurm (simpler, less complex, more reliable)</li>
<li>Refs to slurm-dev mailing list threads</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use existing GRPCPUMins feature in Slurm</li>
<li>Implemented in shell/perl scripts, mainly as a wrapper to sacctmgr
<ul>
<li>adopted similar command-line interface to git ("sbank balance" -&gt; "sbank-balance")</li>
<li>users need only know one command</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provides a workflow for just using Slurm</li>
<li>Turn complex GOLD into an issue of having the user talk to you
<ul>
<li>GOLD: pre-allocated hours; auto-refund didn't always work proplerly for failed jobs (e.g. due to system failure)</li>
<li>sbank: user asks admin for a refund</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flat hierarchy of Associations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create Slurm Associations (called ``projects'')</li>
<li>Add users to projects</li>
<li>Add/subtract hours to/from projects</li>
<li>Workflows to help users track hours
<ul>
<li>checking job scripts for CPU hours</li>
<li>balance statement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try to be self-documenting
<ul>
<li>users need only know one command</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Admin</h2>

<ul>
<li>Walkthrough</li>
</ul>

<h2>User</h2>

<ul>
<li>Walkthrough</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deployed on</h2>

<ul>
<li>SLURM 2.2.x</li>
<li>SL5x (and system version of perl/bash)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Slurm fairshare essentially fails if the period is too long
<ul>
<li>no reset (hard GRPCPUMins limit)</li>
<li>there is no half-life decay, so the user's small usage in the past X
number of weeks is less important than their large usage Y months ago.</li>
<li>people's fairshare tends to zero if they've used a lot of their allocation
`in the past' at any point. Even if they haven't run out of hours, and used
all of those hours Y months.
We sort-of knew that this was going to happen, but it wasn't obvious that it
would become a big issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No support for Slurm hierarchy of Associations</li>
<li>Written as shell/perl, rather than integrated with Slurm source</li>
<li>Disconnect between project expiry and Slurm/Sbank Associations
<ul>
<li>recutils</li>
<li>would need crontab or similar to query and expire Assocations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many small jobs: has the potential to query sacctmgr many times and create a bottleneck</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Experiences</h2>

<ul>
<li>sbank balance written to the slurm-NNN.out file by the Epilog
<ul>
<li>some users notice and read this, others don't</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Policy of our site: create a new Association/project for each new user-submitted
project
<ul>
<li>since priorities/fairshare are calculated on a per-association basis, (no
per-user weighting) it means that someone who's been hammering the queue and
runs out of hours, and then is granted a new project code, all of a sudden has
top priority again, even though someone who's only used half of their
allocation has a fairshare tending towards zero.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Had issues with QoS and multiplier (global vs per-user)
<ul>
<li>Wanted to implement a higher charge-rate for reservations; needs further exploration</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Re-implement in C, and integrate with upstream source</li>
<li><p>We're considering stopping with the whole 'fixed hours' concept of sbank, and
going to a per-quarter reporting with cut-off system.</p>

<ul>
<li>So we use Slurm's fairshare system as intended!</li>
<li>Everyone's usage gets reset every 3 months (and so it levels off new and
existing users).</li>
<li>Half-life decay works again, so my usage in the last week is more important
than last month</li>
<li>Use sreport quarterly to get usage stats.</li>
<li>Compare that to the off-line web application form database, and if someone has
gone over their allocation, that project code is turned off. So someone can
gain some extra, ``unauthorised'' hours, but not for long.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Upgrade to current Slurm</li>
</ul>
