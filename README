SLURM Bank, a collection of wrapper scripts to give slurm GOLD like
capabilities for managing resources.

With the scripts we are able to provide a simple banking system where we
can deposit hours to an account. Users are associated to these accounts
from which they can use to run jobs. If users do not have an account or
if they do not have hours in their account then they cannot run jobs.
