# DESIGN

Based on discussions from 

* http://groups.google.com/group/slurm-devel/browse_frm/thread/1c8805fb274c108f#
* http://groups.google.com/group/slurm-devel/browse_thread/thread/b06f3985cc7504b2?tvc=2

# Requirements

Account enforcing is enabled in *slurm.conf*

	AccountingStorageEnforce=limits

What is also required is a pretty good estimate of the total available
hours that you have on your cluster that you can allocate to accounts.

# Tested on

* SLURM 2.2.0
* SL5x (and system version of perl/sh)
